## Description

Battleship is traditionally a 2-player game in which the players arrange 5 ships of various lengths on a 10x10 board which are hidden to each other.
Objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.
Take turns guessing the location of the opposing battleship,
Win if you destroy all of the opposing battleship, lose if yours is destroyed.

## Deployment

## How to Play

In this variation, there will be three ships of 3 box length.
Place your battleships by clicking on the playerboard.
When you are done, take your guess on the computer's board.

## Key Learnings

## Approach and Process

Storyboarding and wireframe can be done better, helps with coming up with needed variables, functions and logic.
This resulted in numerous bugs and error as implementations have to be slowly added in with constrains.

## Code and Code design

Writing Clean and Concise Code is always a challenge, code readability for others so there is a chance that the program
can be further improved in the future. Hoping to improve code writing and logic thinking as they are essential to building
a program.

## Post Mortem

As my first real attempt into programming, fundamentals have to be greatly improved. Pseudocoding, Logic Thinking and
basic fundamentals concepts of programming are essential.
Conditionals, Booleans, Loops, Objects, Functions, Event targetting, Callbacks, Arrays and Classes are key concepts
that will be used throughout my journey will programming.
