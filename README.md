## Project1: Battleships

## Project Brief

**MVP - Minimum Viable Product**

- Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, jQuery
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Hosted on Github pages
- Commits to Github frequently
- A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
- Be displayed in the browser
- Have some kind of user interaction via mouseclick or keypress

## Timeframe

1 Week

## Technologies & Tools Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Jquery
- Git & GitHub
- Vite


## Description

Battleship is traditionally a 2-player game in which the players arrange 5 ships of various lengths on a 10x10 board which are hidden to each other.
Objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.
Take turns guessing the location of the opposing battleship,
Win if you destroy all of the opposing battleship, lose if yours is destroyed.

## Deployment

https://project1-dew1997.vercel.app/

## How to Play

In this variation, there will be three ships of 3 box length.
Place your battleships by clicking on the playerboard.
When you are done, take your guess on the computer's board.
You win when you destroy all of the battleships, you lose when all your battleship are destroyed!

Red - Hit
Blue - Your Ship
White - Miss

Unsolved problems

- Players are able to fire without placing their battleship.
- Battleships sizes can vary due to the placement function, does not reflect what the actual game of battleships are supposed to be.

## Further Developments/Improvements

This was created for a project submission. If there was to have a future iterations, I would like to attempt again from scratch
a better and playable version of Battleship.

- Fix bugs and errors
- Create different sizes of battleship and make them rotatable.
- Better game visuals using CSS/HTML.
- Recreate the game with shorter and more efficient codes.

## WireFrame

- a 10x 10 grid
- battleships
- fire function
- randomised ship

## Key Learnings

## Approach and Process

Storyboarding and wireframe can be done better, helps with coming up with needed variables, functions and logic.
This resulted in numerous bugs and error as implementations have to be slowly added in with constrains.

## Code and Code design

Writing Clean and Concise Code is always a challenge, code readability for others so there is a chance that the program
can be further improved in the future. Hoping to improve code writing and logic thinking as they are essential to building
a program.

Example of inefficient coding.

## Post Mortem

As my first real attempt into programming, fundamentals have to be greatly improved. Pseudocoding, Logic Thinking and
basic fundamentals concepts of programming are essential.
Conditionals, Booleans, Loops, Objects, Functions, Event targetting, Callbacks, Arrays and Classes are key concepts
that will be used throughout my journey with programming.
Although the project did not turned out as good as possible, It taught me that it is just the beginning and I am eager to learn more.
Patience and never give up.
